# Early Vision: Inclusive AI & HPC

This project is co-created as part of the HPC mentoring program.

## What we want to explore

- What digital transformation tools help women inclusion?
- Are there patterns in sectors or countries?
- Can HPC and data science help analyze this at scale?
- How do we link ethics in AI to real company use cases?

## How this will be done

1. Research & data collection by Valentina (Argentina)
2. Data analysis and notebook development by Lucia (NSCC Slovakia)
3. Common GitHub repo and JIRA coordination
4. Weekly mentoring sync & collaborative learning

## Tools we plan to use

- Python, Pandas, Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub & JIRA
- EuroCC methodology & HPC access
