# Inclusive AI & HPC Project

This project explores inclusive, ethical, and collaborative AI practices with a focus on gender diversity, digital transformation, and applications of High-Performance Computing (HPC).

It was created as a joint effort between mentor Lucia Malíčková (NSCC Slovakia) and her mentee Valentina Waisman in the HPC mentoring program, with the goal of connecting social innovation research with real-world HPC use cases.

## Objectives

- Identify digital tools and practices used to promote inclusion of women in the workforce (focus on Latin America)
- Understand how HPC can support research in the area of diversity and ethics
- Learn and apply open-source technologies like GitHub, Python, and Jupyter
- Connect the research outcomes to NSCC innovation activities and EuroCC projects

## Structure

- `data/`: contains research and tabular data (CSV, XLSX)
- `notebook/`: Jupyter notebooks for simulations, charts, and basic analysis
- `insights/`: markdown summaries, ethical reflections, and best practices

## Tools and Collaboration

- 📊 Python, Pandas, Plotly
- 📁 GitHub for version control and collaboration
- 📋 Jira for project tracking and task management
- 💬 Weekly mentoring sessions, Slack for communication

## Status
